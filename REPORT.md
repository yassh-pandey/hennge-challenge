# Experience:
To be honest I did not face any difficulty in implementing this challenge. I worked on it at night when I had some free time
and it was done in 3-4 days. 

I made everything from scratch by myself and did all the styling in pure CSS (no external library used). I have made this project in such a way so that it is extensible by following the Component architecture which ensures code reusability and relatively easy maintenance.

If I had any doubts I used StackOverflow, React documentation & MDN documentation to resolve them.

That's all I have to say. I hope you would like the work that I have done.
